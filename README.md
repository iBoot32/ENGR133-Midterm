# ENGR133-Midterm
## The code for my ENGR133 midterm at Purdue University: Utilizing a XOR Cipher / Sobel Edge Detection.

## Goals:
- Detects Earth in the infamous "Pale Blue Dot" image captured by NASA using Gaussian Blur and Sobel Edge Detection.
- Encrypts a .tiff image using a simple XOR Cipher
- Decrypts a .tiff image using the input key and a XOR Cipher

## Input/Sample Images:
- enc_1.tiff: image encrypted using XOR Cipher and key=`133`
- enc_2.tiff: image encrypted using XOR Cipher and key=`133`
- mitch.tiff: decrypted result of one encrypted image
- pete.tiff: decrypted result of one encrypted image
- Pale_Blue_Dot_Encrypted.tiff: encrypted pale blue dot image to be used in sobel edge detection. Decrypt with key=`COME AND GET YOUR LOVE`
